 **Part 1 – Problem Framing**


# 1. What is the real business problem?

The core business problem is not pipeline generation, but declining sales efficiency.

The CRO explicitly states that pipeline volume is healthy, meaning there are sufficient deals entering the funnel. However, the win rate has dropped over the last two quarters. This suggests that the issue lies in conversion performance rather than lead volume.

The underlying problem is therefore:  Why are fewer deals converting to wins despite having sufficient pipeline?

Possible causes could include: 

* A shift in deal mix (industry, region, product type)
* Decline in lead quality
* Changes in pricing or competitive positioning
* Sales execution issues (rep performance, longer sales cycles)
* Structural changes in customer demand

The business needs diagnostic clarity to identify whether the issue is related to strategy, execution, or market conditions.


# 2. What key questions should an AI system answer for the CRO?

Based on the CRO’s concern, the AI system should answer two primary questions:

1. What factors are driving the decline in win rate?

* Is the drop concentrated in certain industries, regions, products, or reps?
* Has the pipeline mix changed?
* Are deals taking longer to close?
* Is performance decline widespread or isolated?

2. What actions should leadership prioritize?

* Should focus shift to higher-performing segments?
* Do certain reps require coaching?
* Should qualification criteria be adjusted?
* Is there a need to revisit pricing or targeting strategy?

The AI system should move beyond reporting metrics and provide actionable, prioritized insights.


# 3. What metrics matter most for diagnosing win rate issues?

To diagnose the problem effectively, the following metrics are most critical:

* Win Rate (%) – Primary performance indicator.
* Pipeline Volume (deal count & total ACV) – To confirm funnel health.
* Average Deal Size (ACV) – To detect mix shifts toward smaller or riskier deals.
* Sales Cycle Length – To identify stalled or delayed deals.
* Stage Conversion Rates – To identify friction points in the funnel.
* Win Rate by Segment (industry, region, product, lead source, rep) – To detect concentrated performance drops.

These metrics help decompose overall win rate into actionable drivers.


# 4. What assumptions are being made about the data or business?

Several assumptions are made:

* The company operates across multiple industries and regions.
* All deal amounts are in a consistent currency.
* The dataset accurately records final outcomes (won/lost) without missing or misclassified entries.
* Sales stages reflect real progression and are consistently defined.
* There were no major structural changes (e.g., CRM migration, compensation plan overhaul) that distort historical comparisons.

These assumptions will need validation during exploratory analysis.
